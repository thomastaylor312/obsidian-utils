# Obsidian Utils

This project is meant to be a collection of Unix style CLI utilities to work with
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vaults. It tries to follow the Unix philosophy of doing one thing
and doing it well for each utility. The eventual goal is to have a set of CLI tools that can
replicate many of the features of Obsidian, but in a more scriptable, CLI-first way.
